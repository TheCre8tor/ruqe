# ruqe

## Author: [Alexander Nitiola](https://github.com/thecre8tor)

**Ruqe** brings the convenient types and methods found in Rust into Dart, such as
the `Result`, `Option`, `pattern-matching`, etc. Additionally, the library provides
an excellent concept for `modeling errors without resorting to exceptions`.

## Getting started

In your Dart/Flutter project, add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  ruqe: ^0.0.1
```
